Intro
An image depicting a picture of a blue bird with a black backgroundAn image depicting the logo of the canadian hockey teamChallenge was to automate removing whitespace from floorplan PDFs into PNGs

The initial pass will remove whitespace in floorplan

Two additional tools for edge cases

 Slide 3
Problem Solving Process
An image depicting a picture of a blue bird with a black backgroundAn image depicting the logo of the canadian hockey teamUsed Flood Fill algorithm to change the same color neighboring pixels into transparent ones

Due to how Flood Fill works there were some unexpected results from edge cases

Made two tools to handle the edge casesSlide 4
